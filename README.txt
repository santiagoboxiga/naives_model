## Synopsis

This repository contains a Python script designed to implement a Naive Bayes Classifier for binary classification tasks, with a focus on predicting customer churn based on a provided dataset.

## Contents

├── Naives_Model.py - Implements a Naive Bayes Classifier for training, testing, and evaluating customer churn predictions.

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python modules:

- numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
- csv: For reading and processing the input dataset.

Additional details:

- The dataset file path is specified in the script and should point to Database_Churn.txt or an equivalent file.
- The dataset must have a header row, and columns are expected in a specific format:
- The first column ('Customer ID') is ignored.
- The last column represents the churn label (target variable)
